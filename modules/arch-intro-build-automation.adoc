{productname} supports building Dockerfiles using a set of worker nodes on {ocp} or Kubernetes platforms. Build triggers, such as GitHub webhooks, can be configured to automatically build new versions of your repositories when new code is committed.

Prior to {productname} 3.7, {productname} ran Podman commands in virtual machines launched by pods. Running builds on virtual platforms requires enabling nested virtualization, which is not featured in {rhel} or {ocp}. As a result, builds had to run on bare metal clusters, which is an inefficient use of resources.

Prior to {productname} 3.7, builds required a bare metal {ocp} cluster to support a nested virtual platform. With {productname} 3.7, this requirement has been removed and builds can be run on {ocp} clusters running on virtualized or bare metal platforms.
